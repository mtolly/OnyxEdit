OnyxEdit
========

Rock Band MIDI editor. Made with Haskell, SDL, and OpenAL.

In a very rough state right now!

* Will be mostly keyboard-controlled.

* Allow you to view/edit all of an instrument's data in one unified screen.
  For example, generate drum notes and drummer animations from the same source,
  or generate basic guitar and pro guitar in a unified way.
